      <p>Humans can categorize and identify often by using common sense.
        Why was image B a constellation?
        How did you know?
        Maybe you recognized the Big Dipper.
        Maybe you used deductive reasoning after seeing that image A was not of a constellation.
        Or maybe you used common sense, and you knew image B is of a constellation, simply beacuse it is.</p>

        <p>But a computer cannot do this!
          A computer doesn't know what "stars" are, or what "trees" are. 
          A computer doesn't have the same common sense that we do that allows us to "just know" image B is of a cosntellation.
          So... how does a computer learn to identify constellations?
